  "body": "This is simple snippet to add php codesniffer and autofixer commands in sublime build. <p>So whenever we are on some file we can simply run command+b to run sniffer and get result in sublime console and can run command+shift+b to choose between sniffer and autofixer.</p> For this we must have php code sniffer installed. If not then installed it by composer as: `composer install -g coder` Once we have it installed successfully, we can test it by try running phpcs by ~/.composer/vendor/bin/phpcs --help. When everything looks fine then download the sublime-build file from https://gist.github.com/crazyrohila/ef53a7b896bf6d5fce2980c576a27172 and put this in User Package folder of sublime. If you are not sure where the Package directory is then go to Preference->Browse Packages. Now restart sublime and run command+shift+b , you should see DrupalCoder and DrupalCoder - Run as option."
